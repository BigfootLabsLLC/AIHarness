## Documents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `HighLevel.md` | Project overview and core philosophy |
| `Planning.md` | Detailed feature specifications and TODOs |

## Quick Start

1. Read `HighLevel.md` for the vision
2. Review `Planning.md` for feature details
3. Check `ImplementationRoadmap.md` for development phases

## Key Concepts

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Run multiple AI agents with different models/roles
- **Cost-Aware Routing**: Automatically use cheaper models for appropriate tasks
- **Delegation Pipeline**: Architecture → Spec → Implementation workflow
- **Agent-to-Agent Review**: Agents review each other's work
